This directory contains our fork of libwpg-0.1.3.

We decided to fork this library for the following reasons.

- no need for users to install 2 librarys only for using the WPG import plugin
- Development of libwpg seems to have stopped (no committ in the past 7 Months)
- we can tailor the library to our specific needs
- already added a lot of features and corrections, which result in some
  incompatible API changes.
