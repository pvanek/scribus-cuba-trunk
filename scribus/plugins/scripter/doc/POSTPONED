Some things will be realized differently at a later stage for different reasons:

It was planned that there is a scripts-repository.
 * The used Django web framework changed some APIs (admin, newforms)
   which needs some porting. A stable API will be available with the 
   1.0 release in September and it makes sense to wait for it.
 * There has been scribusstuff.org announced which might be a better solution
   or at least some collaboration might be possible (at least via
   ghns-protocoll, see http://ghns.freedesktop.org/)

To use the repository an integrated scripts browser was planned.
 * It is unclear if the browser should access scribusstuff.org or an
   own repository (with probably another protocol).
 * Hacking with QTextBrowser proved to be a bad hack. Therefore I want
   to use WebKit and its new network API but currently Scribus avoids a 
   dependency on Qt >= 4.4. So I have to wait a little bit.
