Between the old prototype and the current version there are several
changes. A lot of code was cleaned up. Additionally the plug-in type
was changed from ScActionPlugin to ScPersistentPlugin.

Currently you cannot see that much except some debug messages on the
console. The other new stuff is under the hood.

For testing make sure that the plug-in is loaded. Therefore open the
global preferences dialog and look in the plug-ins section.

If you want to know how to integrate the plug-in into your build please 
see the INSTALL file.


You need the newest PyQt release, available at 
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

Unfortunately version 4.4 is not available in most current distributions. 
But for Ubuntu you can use the Intrepid Ibex packages at
